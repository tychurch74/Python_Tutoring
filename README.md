# Learning Python

## Before You Can Write Code:
1. Download and install Python for MacOs from python.org
2. Download and install VS Code for MacOs from microsoft
3. Open VS Code and on the left side tool bar click "extensions" and type in "python". Click and install the result from microsoft just called "python"
4. Click on the left side tool bar again on the icon named "explorer"
5. In the area that just opened right click, "new file", and name the file anything you'd like followed by '.py'
6. Click on "view" on the top ribbon and then click "command pallete"
7. Type "python: create environment", click on the result and keep clicking through until a dialoge box appears at the bottom right saying "creating virtual environment"
8. And thats it; steps 1-4 only need to be done once and steps 5-8 only need to be done when starting completely new projects.

## Navigating This Repo:
Start by opening the folder named "basics"
There will be files in there, each numbered in the order you should open them and read through.
Some files are simple text files while others are actual python code you can run. There are also folders named "self tests" and "examples". "self tests" contain small fill in the blank coding assignments for you to test your own knowledge. "examples" contains some example programs I've written for you to see some of what you can do with Python.

Once you work through the basics folder you can move on to "intermediate" where the same format applies.
